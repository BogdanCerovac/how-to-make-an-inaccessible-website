# How To Make An Inaccessible Website

Everyone is **different**.  Everyone thinks and behaves **differently**.  That's what makes us unique. Web accessibility is about making the web for everyone, being inclusive and providing access for all. 

In order to do that it is important to recognise the different areas, skills and roles that impact on accessibility.  It's not just content that affects accessibility of a website but it is also influenced by design, development, performance, and security amongst other things.  Naturally, there will be some overlap.

The following is an **incomplete** list has been used to create an inaccessible website, more on that to follow.  Here's my brain dump.
